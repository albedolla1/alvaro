A fixture is a collection of data that Django knows how to import into a database. 
The most straightforward way of creating a fixture if you've already got some data 
is to use the manage.py dumpdata command. ... Each time you run loaddata , the data 
will be read from the fixture and re-loaded into the database.

Using this, we can load all the fixture file information into tables. This files/information 
has a specific pattern, so that it matches and easily loads into the tables.

For example:

    "model": "home.StorageSixA",
        "pk": 2,
        "fields": {
        "item": "vaseline / petroleum gauze dressing",
        "location": "aa2"
        }

    Here, we are saying to load this information to sixA model by mentioning -> "model": "home.StorageSixA",

    "pk": 2,
    Mentioning Primary key

    "fields": {
        "item": "vaseline / petroleum gauze dressing",
        "location": "aa2"
        }
    This is the data
